software factories (almost lights out) are super real but we need to be realistic. the factory aspects haven’t been cracked yet, the innovators are toying around with discovering practices and pieces. if someone is selling you a factory rn and they aren’t in the super small cohort (ie. they are likely startups created in last six months!) or circa <10 people in the who’s-who, who have been trying (and realistically failing) over the last two years. they are selling bullshit.

it isn’t cracked but it’s a puzzle that’s being solved daily. the best practices right now are to build abstractions/pieces needed which entails solving non-agent topics: sandboxing, monorepo, reproducible builds, ci/cd, identity/secret management, smashing corporate friction in the realm of devex for agents.

at home, in your homelab, you should be cracking on this problem space in your free time if you want a super fast promotion and red carpet service at your next interview. highest roi you can have right now is learning the entire damn stack, automating it and showing it at your next interview/doing a recorded talk at a meetup.

**Editor's note.** Three posts from 29 July 2026, in the order Huntley posted them. The numbered side-notes he hung on the first are set at the words they mark, except the longest, which stands as the paragraph above.

## Factories are not a token or llm problem

i must stress that factories is not a token or llm problem. it’s a systems engineering and corporate culture problem. it won’t be solved through tokens or how you apply the tokens (but it is a piece of the puzzle) ugh. blog post time.

**Editor's note.** The last post is that systems-engineering claim worked out on one system: the service bus, and the visual workflow-automation tool n8n. Its "second" counts from an earlier post the captures do not identify.

## Don't make the entire service bus non-deterministic

second hot take, as it seems the first hot take landed. n8n was a silly idea, which i’ve always suspected was developed by young folks in silicon valley who are all in on the LLM craze who have never worked in corporate in their life thus didn’t have the knowledge that service busses are a solved problem and there’s deep prior art in the spooky land of enterprise.

look up anything in the @dotnet space such as mass transit, nservicebus, wcf (lots of bad memories here, not great tech impl but the theory / education is generally on point) if you wanna steal ideas for prompting. if you want a modern plug and play choice, @temporalio exists. use it and have a job invoke an agent as a process. don’t make the entire service bus non-deterministic.
