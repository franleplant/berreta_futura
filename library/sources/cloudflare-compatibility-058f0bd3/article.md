# Cloudflare compatibility

celld runs the Workers runtime, with Durable Objects as the stateful
core: module Workers, fetch, JS RPC, service bindings, and static assets.
This page shows that Worker surface, API by API. celld does not run the
rest of the Cloudflare platform, and the scope rule is simple: if
Cloudflare builds a function on Durable Objects, celld can get that
function, and a function on a different primitive is out of scope.
Cloudflare builds D1 on Durable Objects, so a D1 binding is a thin layer
over what celld already has. KV is a global cache with eventual
consistency, and R2 is blob storage: different systems, not on the
roadmap.

A configuration or binding that is not available must fail loudly, at
deploy or at first use. A silent compatibility gap is a bug; the known
gaps have marks below.

## Services

| service | notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Workers** | Module Workers: `fetch`, JS RPC, service bindings, Durable Object bindings, `vars`. |
| **Durable Objects** | The stateful core. SQLite storage, alarms, inbound hibernatable WebSockets, outbound `ws:`/`wss:` WebSocket clients (constructor and `fetch()` upgrade), one writer for each cell, names as addresses, RPC methods on stubs. |
| **Static assets** | Immutable files, served from the fleet bucket: `assets.directory`, `binding`, `html_handling`, `not_found_handling`, `run_worker_first`, plus `_headers` and `_redirects`. An asset-only project deploys without a Worker. |
| **Worker Loader (Code Mode)** | Experimental. Bind a loader with `CELLD_WORKER_LOADER`. A Worker can then start sandboxed isolates at runtime. See [Dynamic Worker loading](#dynamic-worker-loading-code-mode). |

Planned: **D1** (a D1 database is a Durable Object with a SQL API; celld
already has the hard part), **Workflows** (durable execution over cells
and alarms), **Queues** (a Durable Object shape; if demand appears).

A note on durable execution, because the two terms are close. A
durable-execution engine (Temporal, Restate, Azure Durable Functions)
models a process: a sequence of steps that ends. A cell models an
entity: a named unit with state that persists indefinitely. You can
build either primitive on the other — Cloudflare builds Workflows on
Durable Objects — so choose the one that matches the shape of the
problem. A concert, a user, and a document are entities; an order
pipeline is a process.

Not planned: **KV** (a different consistency model), **R2** (celld runs
*on* blob storage; celld does not provide blob storage; declared
`r2_buckets` bindings load, but each method throws), **Cache API**,
**Workers AI, Vectorize, Hyperdrive, Browser Rendering, Email** (managed
platform services; an experimental HTTP adapter for an AI binding exists
behind `CELLD_AI_URL`), **cron triggers, custom domains, TLS
termination** (platform surface; celld has its own durable alarms; put
TLS in your ingress proxy).

## Runtime APIs

Cloudflare's [Runtime APIs
index](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/), category
by category:

| API | status |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch, Request, Response, Headers | **Yes.** Gaps: `Response.redirect()`, `Response.error()`, and the `cache` request option are missing. |
| Bindings (`env`) | **Yes** for Durable Objects, service bindings, `vars`, assets. Other binding types are out of scope (see Services). |
| Context (`ctx`) | **Yes**: `waitUntil`, `props`, `exports`. `passThroughOnException()` is accepted but has no effect. There is no CDN behind it. `ctx.facets` is absent (see Facets). |
| Handlers | `fetch`, `alarm`, `webSocketMessage`/`Close`/`Error`, RPC methods. **No** `scheduled` (cron), `queue`, `tail`, or `email` handlers. |
| RPC | **Yes**, for most of the surface. See [RPC](#rpc). |
| Streams | **Yes.** This includes byte streams, BYOB readers, `tee`/`pipeTo`/`pipeThrough`, `IdentityTransformStream`, `FixedLengthStream`, and `CompressionStream`/`DecompressionStream`. Gap: `ReadableStream.from()`. |
| Encoding | **Yes**: `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` (legacy encodings included), encoder and decoder streams, `atob`/`btoa`. |
| WebSockets | **Yes**, inbound (hibernatable, with attachments) and outbound. An attachment holds anything that structured clone accepts. Auto-response works: `setWebSocketAutoResponse` answers a matched message without a wake of the cell. Gap: `getTags()`. |
| Web Crypto | **Partial**: `digest` (including MD5), HMAC sign and verify, AES-GCM, RSA-OAEP decrypt, Ed25519 and ECDSA-P256 sign, and `verify` for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and ECDSA-P256 (RS256 and ES256 JWTs). `importKey` and `exportKey` handle `spki`, `pkcs8`, `jwk` and `raw` for RSA, EC (P-256, P-384, P-521), Ed25519 and X25519, validating at import; keys cross to `node:crypto` through `KeyObject.from()`. `generateKey` covers AES, HMAC, RSA (OAEP, PKCS#1 v1.5, PSS), EC P-256 and Ed25519. Cloudflare's extensions `timingSafeEqual` and `DigestStream` (with CRC32, CRC32C and CRC64-NVME) are available. AES-CBC, AES-CTR and AES-GCM (12- or 16-byte IVs). ECDH `deriveBits` and `deriveKey` on P-256, P-384 and P-521. Missing: `wrapKey`/`unwrapKey`, RSA-PSS *signing*, HKDF and PBKDF2 through `deriveBits` (they are available through `node:crypto`). An algorithm that is not available throws. |
| Web standards | **Yes**: `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `URLPattern`, `AbortController`/`AbortSignal` (with `timeout()`, `any()`; a signal does **not** abort across an RPC call, and `signal.onabort` is accepted but never invoked — use `addEventListener('abort')`), `Blob`/`File`/`FormData`, `Event`/`EventTarget`, `DOMException`, `queueMicrotask`, `structuredClone` (not conformant on exotic types), `navigator.userAgent`. |
| WebAssembly | **Yes** (V8's own, without restrictions). A bundle can import a `.wasm` file as a compiled module, as on Cloudflare; see [WebAssembly](https://celld.dev/docs/wasm). |
| Performance and timers | `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `scheduler.wait()`. `setInterval` throws. `performance.now()` has millisecond resolution. The other parts of `performance` are stubs. |
| Console | `log`/`info`/`warn`/`error` are real. `debug`/`trace`/`group`/`table` do nothing. `assert`/`time`/`count` are absent. |
| Node.js compatibility | **Partial.** See [node: imports](#node-imports). |
| Facets (`ctx.facets`) | **No.** A Durable Object cannot create a facet, and `ctx.facets` is not defined. celld also has no first-class `DurableObjectClass` value, so `ctx.exports` gives no stub for a Durable Object class that the configuration does not declare. |
| Cache (`caches`) | **No.** |
| HTMLRewriter | **No.** |
| TCP sockets (`cloudflare:sockets`) | **No.** Known silent gap: `connect()` currently gives an inert stub. It does not throw. |
| EventSource, MessageChannel, BroadcastChannel | **No.** The classes exist so that bundles load, but they do nothing. |

## RPC

celld implements the Workers [JS RPC
system](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/):
`WorkerEntrypoint` and `RpcTarget` from `cloudflare:workers`, named
entrypoints on service bindings, and method calls on Durable Object stubs
(this needs `extends DurableObject`, or the `js_rpc` compat flag).
Arguments and returns use structured clone. Functions, streams, and
`RpcTarget`s become stubs. Promise pipelining, `ctx.exports` loopback
stubs, and stubs in DO storage are available. `ctx.exports` covers the
entrypoints that the configuration declares, so it gives no stub for an
undeclared Durable Object class.

The current limits: a cross-isolate service binding with a named
entrypoint can do single method calls, but not `fetch()`, awaitable
properties, or pipelined paths; a same-isolate binding has the full
surface.

A stub cannot cross an isolate boundary yet, and a Durable Object is its
own isolate. A Durable Object method therefore takes and returns
structured-cloneable values. If you pass a function to one, or return an
`RpcTarget` from one, the call throws `RPC stubs cannot cross isolate boundaries yet`. Callbacks, `RpcTarget` instances and promise pipelining
all work through `ctx.exports`, which shares the isolate. The
[`rpc` example](https://github.com/denoland/celld/tree/main/examples/rpc)
shows each of these.

## Dynamic Worker loading (Code Mode)

Set `CELLD_WORKER_LOADER=LOADER`. Workers then get `env.LOADER`. This is
an experimental port of Cloudflare's [Worker
Loader](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/worker-loader/).
`loader.get(name, getCode)` (memoized) and `loader.load(code)` start a
new isolate for each loaded worker. These inputs are honored:
`mainModule`, sibling `modules`, `compatibilityDate`/`Flags`, plain-JSON
`env`, and `globalOutbound: null` (no egress). The limits of workerd
apply: 64 MiB of code and 1 MiB of env, plus the
`CELLD_MAX_LOADED_WORKERS` limit. A loaded worker serves `fetch()` and
single RPC method calls. Not yet available: `globalOutbound` as a
Fetcher, capability stubs in `env`, awaitable or pipelined properties.

## node: imports

`node:` specifiers are always available; the `nodejs_compat` flag is not
necessary, and celld does not read it. `celld deploy` externalizes
`node:*` at bundle time. The runtime supplies its own subset (it does not
use the Wrangler-style unenv polyfills):

- **Implemented**: `node:assert`, `node:async_hooks` (a real
  `AsyncLocalStorage`), `node:buffer`, `node:events`, `node:path`,
  `node:stream` (+ `stream/web`, `stream/promises`, `stream/consumers`),
  `node:timers/promises`, `node:util`.
- **Partial**: `node:crypto` (hashes, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2, `webcrypto`, secret
  key objects, asymmetric keys, and one-shot signatures. `createPublicKey` and
  `createPrivateKey` read PEM, DER and JWK for RSA, EC (P-256, P-384, P-521),
  Ed25519, X25519 and DSA, including password-protected PKCS#8, and give a key
  with `asymmetricKeyType`, `asymmetricKeyDetails`, `toCryptoKey()` and
  `export()` to DER, PEM or JWK. `generateKeyPairSync` covers RSA, EC P-256,
  Ed25519 and X25519. `sign()` and `verify()` cover Ed25519, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5
  and ECDSA P-256, with DER signatures as Node's `dsaEncoding` default
  requires. What still throws: Diffie-Hellman throughout, the streaming
  `createSign`/`createVerify`, ciphers, RSA-PSS, DSA signing, and key
  generation for DSA and DH), `node:zlib` (only the sync `gzip`/`deflate`
  family), `node:fs` (reads fail with `ENOENT`, `existsSync` is `false`).
- **Not implemented**: the rest — `node:http(s)`, `node:net`,
  `node:tls`, `node:dns`, `node:os`, `node:process` (the `process`
  global exists, the module does not), `node:worker_threads`, `node:vm`,
  `node:child_process`, and the others. Known silent gap: these
  currently give inert stubs. They do not fail the import.

## Compatibility flags

`compatibility_date` and `compatibility_flags` are honored for the
switches that celld models: `delete_all_deletes_alarm`, `js_rpc`,
`fetcher_no_get_put_delete`, `websocket_standard_binary_type`, and the
assets navigation behavior. `Cloudflare.compatibilityFlags` reports only
the flags that celld honors. A flag that celld does not model is absent
rather than reported as enabled, and celld accepts it without effect.

## Wrangler configuration

`celld deploy` builds a standard Wrangler project (esbuild on `PATH`)
and accepts `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.json`, not `wrangler.toml`.
The available config keys are `name`, `main`,
`compatibility_date`, `compatibility_flags`, `durable_objects`,
`migrations`, `assets`, `services`, and `vars`. An asset-only project can
omit `main`. celld refuses symlinks and special files in the asset
directory, and `.assetsignore` still needs Wrangler. Each other key —
`routes`, `kv_namespaces`, `triggers`, and the rest — stops the deploy
with an error that names the key: remove the key, or deploy that project
with Wrangler.

operational boundaries of the current release — TLS, platforms, pressure
shedding, updates — see the [limitations](https://celld.dev/docs/limitations).
