# Limitations

The boundaries of the current alpha:

- A fleet runs one application deployment. There is no multi-tenant scheduler, no account service, or managed ingress.
- celld requires an S3-compatible bucket or a Google Cloud Storage bucket, also on a laptop. There is no local filesystem mode, so local development needs a real bucket or a local store that provides conditional writes (see [ownership and fencing](https://celld.dev/docs/fencing)).
- The peer HTTP protocol does not terminate TLS. Run the fleet on a private network or an encrypted overlay, and terminate public TLS in an ingress proxy.
- The fleet bucket is the administrative authority, so give its credentials a narrow scope; celld does not make shared object-store credentials safe.
- The bucket credentials come from the `AWS_*` environment or from explicit managed credentials, which includes instance metadata and web identity tokens. celld does not read `~/.aws` profiles or SSO logins. A `gs://` bucket authenticates with Google Application Default Credentials or with a service account key from the `GOOGLE_*` environment; S3 static credentials do not apply to it.
- The [Cloudflare compatibility](https://celld.dev/docs/cloudflare-compat) page shows what celld runs of the Workers platform: the available APIs, the deploy contract, and what is out of scope (KV, R2, `wrangler.toml`, routes). An unknown key or API causes a loud failure; a silent gap is a bug.
- Each node can be the WebSocket ingress for each cell through the signed peer tunnel, but the test coverage for close codes and reconnections across nodes is thinner than for one node. If latency is important, send the traffic of a cell to its owner node.
- An outbound Durable Object WebSocket keeps its cell resident, and the connection does not continue when the cell moves to a different node: keep the connection intent in storage, and connect again after the activation. (A Worker's outbound socket stops with its request, the same as on Cloudflare.) A node limits how much residency the outbound sockets can hold.
- Windows is not available, and Intel Macs get no prebuilt binaries; a build from source works.
- celld has no central placement controller, so it does not rebalance the fleet when a node joins. Normal traffic places an unowned or released cell on a node with capacity.
- Updates are manual: the installer keeps immutable releases behind one `current` pointer, so a previous SHA is the rollback. There is no automatic update agent.
