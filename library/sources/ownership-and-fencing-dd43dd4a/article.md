# Ownership and fencing

## The ownership record

Each cell has one ownership record in the bucket. The record names the owner node's session and carries a fencing epoch. A node acquires a cell with a conditional write: a create when no record exists, and a compare-and-swap on the previous record when one does. The bucket accepts one such write, so two nodes cannot acquire the same cell.

Every activation advances the epoch. A takeover advances it, and a local wake advances it too. Each owner therefore replicates under a fresh epoch, and an epoch never has two writers.

## Replication and the epoch prefix

The replicator copies the SQLite data of each cell to the bucket under an epoch prefix: `cells/<cell>/ltx/e<epoch>/`. These segment writes are plain, unconditional PUTs. That is intentional: the fence is the epoch in the key, not a condition on the request. A node that lost its ownership can continue to write, but its writes land in a superseded prefix. A restore selects the current lineage, so the stale node cannot corrupt the data of the new owner, and the data path pays no conditional-write cost.

The prefix protects the data. It does not, alone, protect the promise to the client. The next two mechanisms close that gap.

## The acknowledgement rule (RPO=0)

A gate holds the response of each write until the replicator proves that the write is in the bucket. After the proof, celld reads the ownership record one time, and celld acknowledges only if the record still names this node at this epoch. A partitioned node can commit locally and replicate into its own superseded prefix, but its ownership read shows the new owner, so the client never receives an acknowledgement for a write that the surviving lineage does not contain. The check is a read of the record, not a clock comparison, so a paused process or a skewed clock cannot pass it.

## The epoch seal

A restore selects the newest epoch prefix that contains data. A fenced node can append to that prefix after the takeover, because the segment writes are unconditional. Without a further rule, a later restore could read that appended tail: writes that no client saw acknowledged.

The seal closes this hole. The first activation that restores from an epoch writes a seal object (`e<epoch>.seal.json`) with a conditional create, and the seal fixes the highest transaction that any restore of that epoch can read. The conditional create means that the first restorer wins, so every later restore reads the same cut. Every acknowledged write sits at or below the seal, because the acknowledgement required an ownership read, and the takeover preceded the seal. The later writes of the fenced node sit above the seal, so they never return. If the seal write fails, the activation fails, because a restore of an unsealed prefix reopens the hole.

## Self-fencing

A node that cannot reach the bucket cannot renew its lease, and it cannot replicate. Such a node must not own cells, so it fences itself: it stops the writes and releases its residency. A different node can then acquire the cells through the ownership records. The failure of a node is a normal input, not a recovery procedure; the [testing page](https://celld.dev/docs/testing) shows the kill tests that exercise this path.

## What the bucket must provide

celld needs three properties from the object store:

- A conditional create. The create must fail when the object already exists.
- A conditional overwrite. The write must fail when the object changed after the read.
- Read-after-write consistency. A read after a successful write must return that write.

On an S3-compatible bucket, celld sends the `If-None-Match: *` and `If-Match` headers, and the condition compares the etag. Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, and Tigris document these operations. celld's release tests run against Cloudflare R2, and the AWS S3 path uses the same client and the same headers.

A `gs://` bucket selects Google Cloud Storage. celld then uses the Cloud Storage XML API with the `x-goog-if-generation-match` precondition and OAuth credentials, and the condition compares the object generation. celld does not send the S3 request dialect to Cloud Storage, because Cloud Storage does not apply `If-Match` to a PUT.

Some S3-compatible stores do not qualify. MinIO (the community edition), Backblaze B2, Hetzner Object Storage, and DigitalOcean Spaces do not implement the required conditional writes. celld is not correct on such a store: two nodes can then own one cell. A store can also accept the conditional headers and not apply the condition, and that store fails late and silently, so test a store before you trust a fleet to it.
